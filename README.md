## Colors

There seem to be a lot of freedom choosing colors for the Go Gopher.
But there are [color suggestions](documentation/colors.md) if you are looking for a classic original Go Gopher style.

## 3D printable

The 3D printable gopher is separated into body and eyes. Pupils are high-techlically added post production using a marker pen.

## 3D object files

### Maya file (*.mb)

The original 3D file for the Go Gopher mascot.

`go_gopher.mb`

Maya render results:

### Wavefront OBJ files (*.obj)

The original obj-file of the 3D gopher (`go_gopher_high.obj`) is exported from maya (?) without any mtl side car file  (`go_gopher_high.mtl`). And is thus uncolored.

## How come the 3D Go Gopher was created? 

The conversation went something like this:

> Walter (Developer): Go uses a Gopher as a mascot. We just want to highlight the language in a project.
>
> David (Animator): Here you go.
>
> Walter (Developer): Whoa that's trick. Why the sweet 3D animation?
>
> David (Animator): Because I can.

Which then results in animated jibbily jelly go gophers uniting on Vine:

Which then finally results in this repo of all the Go Gopher goodness. Enjoy!
